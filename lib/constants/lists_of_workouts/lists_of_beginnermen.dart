      // jumping jacks

1. Stand with your feet together and your arms at your sides.
2. Jump up into the air.
3. While in the air, spread your legs apart and simultaneously raise your arms out to the sides and above your head. Your body should form a star shape.
4. Land softly on the balls of your feet with your legs spread and your arms overhead.
5. Jump again and return to the starting position with your feet together and arms at your sides.
6. Repeat the motion for the desired number of repetitions.

// incline push-ups
     ''' Incline push-ups are a variation of the traditional push-up exercise that make the movement slightly easier by reducing the amount of body weight you have to lift. They are a good option for beginners or individuals who may not have the strength to perform regular push-ups yet. Here's how to do incline push-ups:

1. Find a sturdy, elevated surface like a bench, step, or a stable piece of furniture, such as a coffee table or a sturdy chair.
2. Stand facing the elevated surface and place your hands on it, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Your hands should be at about chest height or slightly higher, depending on your comfort and strength level.
3. Walk your feet backward until your body forms a straight line from your head to your heels. Your feet should be hip-width apart.
4. Engage your core to keep your body in a straight line, and make sure your neck, back, and hips are in alignment.
5. Lower your chest toward the elevated surface by bending your elbows. Keep your elbows close to your body, and focus on a controlled descent.
6. Once your chest is close to the surface (ideally until your chest lightly touches it), push through your palms and straighten your arms to return to the starting position.
7. Perform the desired number of repetitions.

// knee push-ups

1. Start by getting into a plank position with your hands placed slightly wider than shoulder-width apart on the floor or mat. Your wrists should be aligned with your shoulders.
2. Lower yourself to your knees, keeping your lower legs and feet off the ground. Cross your ankles behind you.
3. Keep your body in a straight line from your head to your knees. Engage your core to maintain this alignment.
4. Bend your elbows and lower your chest towards the floor while keeping your back straight. Go as low as you can while maintaining good form.

// push ups
   

     ''' Push-ups are a classic and effective bodyweight exercise that primarily target the chest, shoulders, and triceps while also engaging the core and several other muscle groups. Here's how to perform a basic push-up:

1. Start in a plank position with your hands placed slightly wider than shoulder-width apart on the floor or a mat. Your wrists should be aligned with your shoulders, and your body should form a straight line from your head to your heels.

2. Engage your core muscles to maintain a straight and strong posture throughout the exercise. Avoid arching your back or letting your hips sag.

3. Lower your body towards the floor by bending your elbows. Keep your elbows close to your body, and aim to bring your chest as close to the ground as possible without touching it.

4. Once your chest is near the ground or as low as you can comfortably go, push through your palms and extend your arms to return to the starting position.

5. Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions.

// wide arm push-ups
''' Wide-arm push-ups are a variation of the traditional push-up exercise that specifically target the chest muscles while also engaging the shoulders and triceps. Here's how to perform wide-arm push-ups:

1. Start in a plank position with your hands placed wider than shoulder-width apart on the floor or a mat. Your fingers should be pointing forward or slightly turned outward.

2. Maintain a straight line from your head to your heels. Your wrists should be aligned with your shoulders, and your body should be in a straight and strong position.

3. Engage your core muscles to keep your back from sagging or your hips from rising too high.

4. Lower your body toward the ground by bending your elbows. Keep your elbows pointed outward rather than close to your body. Your chest should move toward the space between your hands.

5. Go as low as you can comfortably, ideally until your chest is just above the ground or mat.

6. Push through your palms and extend your arms to return to the starting position.

7. Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions.

// cobra stretch


     '''The cobra stretch is a yoga pose that stretches the muscles of the chest, abdomen, and lower back. It's a great way to improve flexibility and reduce tension in the upper body. Here's how to do the cobra stretch:

1. Start by lying face down on a mat or the floor. Extend your legs straight behind you, and place your palms flat on the floor, just under your shoulders. Your fingers should be pointing forward.

2. Press your hips, thighs, and the tops of your feet into the floor. This will create a stable base for the stretch.

3. Inhale deeply and slowly begin to lift your chest off the ground. Keep your elbows slightly bent and your lower body anchored to the floor. Use your back muscles to lift your upper body.

4. Continue to lift your chest and head, looking forward or slightly upward, but avoid straining your neck by looking too far up. Keep your neck in a neutral position.

5. Hold the pose for a few breaths, keeping your shoulders relaxed and away from your ears. Focus on the stretch in your chest and the gentle arch in your lower back.

6. To release the stretch, exhale and slowly lower your chest back down to the mat.

// chest stretch

     '''Stretching your chest muscles is important for maintaining good posture and preventing muscle tightness. Here's a simple chest stretch that you can do:

1. Stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart.

2. Extend your arms straight out to the sides, parallel to the ground, so that your body forms a "T" shape. Your palms should be facing forward.

3. Take a deep breath in and as you exhale, gently squeeze your shoulder blades together and push your chest forward.

4. Keep your arms extended and feel a stretch across your chest. You should feel a gentle pulling sensation in your chest muscles.

5. Hold this stretch for 15-30 seconds while maintaining relaxed, even breathing.

6. Slowly release the stretch and bring your arms back to your sides.
