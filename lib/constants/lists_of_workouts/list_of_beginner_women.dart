  // wall push ups
  '''Wall push-ups are a beginner-friendly variation of the traditional push-up exercise. They are an excellent way to build upper body strength, particularly in the chest, shoulders, and triceps. Wall push-ups are also a good option for those who may have difficulty with traditional push-ups due to lower fitness levels or physical limitations. Here's how to perform wall push-ups:

Stand facing a sturdy wall with your feet hip-width apart.
The wall should be smooth and clean, free of any obstructions.
Place your hands flat on the wall at shoulder height, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
Your palms should be pressed firmly against the wall, and your fingers should be pointing upward or slightly outward.
Wall push-ups are a great way to gradually build upper body strength and can be used as a stepping stone to progress to traditional floor push-ups as you become stronger. Focus on maintaining proper form and gradually increasing the number of repetitions or the angle of your body to make the exercise more challenging over time.
