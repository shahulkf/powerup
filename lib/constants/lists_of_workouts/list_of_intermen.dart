  // ABDOMINAL CRUNCHES

  '''Abdominal crunches, often simply called "crunches," are a popular exercise for strengthening the abdominal muscles, particularly the rectus abdominis. Here's how to perform a basic abdominal crunch:

Starting Position:

Lie on your back on a mat or flat surface.
Bend your knees and place your feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart.
Keep your arms relaxed at your sides or gently supporting your head (avoid pulling on your neck).
It's essential to maintain proper form while doing abdominal crunches to prevent neck strain and lower back discomfort. Avoid pulling on your neck with your hands, and use your abdominal muscles to perform the movement. If you're a beginner or have any concerns, you can start with a partial range of motion and gradually work your way up to a full crunch.''',
