  // bicycle crunches
'''Bicycle crunches are a highly effective core exercise that targets not only your rectus abdominis (the front of your abs) but also your obliques (the muscles on the sides of your waist). This exercise is often incorporated into ab workouts and can help strengthen your core while also improving your coordination. Here's how to perform bicycle crunches:
Lie down on your back on a mat or a comfortable surface.
Place your hands gently behind your head, lightly supporting your neck, but avoid pulling on it.
Bend your knees and lift your feet off the ground, so your thighs are perpendicular to the floor.
Keep your lower back pressed into the ground by engaging your core muscles
Ensure you perform bicycle crunches with controlled, deliberate movements and focus on engaging your core throughout the exercise. Avoid pulling on your neck with your hands, as this can lead to strain. Instead, use your core muscles to lift your head and shoulders off the ground. Bicycle crunches are a dynamic core exercise that can help you strengthen your abdominal muscles and enhance core stability.
